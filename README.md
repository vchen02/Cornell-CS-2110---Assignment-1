Learning objectives
* Gain familiarity with the structure of a class within a record-keeping scenario (a common type of application)
* Learn about and practice reading carefully
* Work with examples of good Javadoc specifications to serve as models for your later code
* Learn the code presentation conventions for this course (Javadoc specifications, indentation, short lines, etc.),
which help make your programs readable and understandable.
* Learn and practice incremental coding, a sound programming methodology that interleaves coding and testing.
* Learn about and practice thorough testing of a program using JUnit testing.
* Learn to write class invariants.
* Learn about preconditions of a method (requirements of a call on the method that need not be tested) and the
use of the Java assert statement for checking preconditions.

computations.
